This is a school project I wrote in grade 11.

It simulates a chat program in which the client can enter text that will be corrected by the Server.

The server corrects it by using a self written Neuronal Network that has been trained with a small wordlist.

Some parts of the rendering will be performed on the GPU using CUDA.

The programm is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended to be used in real life applications.
